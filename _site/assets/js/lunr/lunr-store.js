You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.   Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:   YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP   Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.   Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:   def print_hi(name)   puts \"Hi, #{name}\" end print_hi('Tom') #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.  Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.
