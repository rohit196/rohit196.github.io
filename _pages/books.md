ðŸ“š Each book is a journey, not a destination. This collection maps my intellectual wanderings â€” from code-filled technical expeditions to philosophical odysseys that challenged my worldview. I've marked the paths that transformed my thinking, sparked creative epiphanies, or simply provided solace during turbulent times.

Some were fleeting encounters, others longtime companions. All have left their imprint. As Borges once wrote, "I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library." Welcome to a small corner of mine.
